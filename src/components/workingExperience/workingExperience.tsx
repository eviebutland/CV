            <p>
              Following a promotion in December 2022, I took in further
              responsibly within the team. This included bringing forward new
              ideas and executing them to ensure a stable platform as the
              product usage continues to grow. I have built a strong
              relationship with stake holders with the company, collaborating to
              solve complex issues our users face on a regular basis. This in
              turn has helped me build knowledge on problem solving and creating
              simple solutions to complex problems.

            <h3>Fullstack Software Developer</h3>
            <p>
              In order to expand my knowledge, I joined the Argi-Tech SAAS start
              up in September 2021. In this role, I learnt to work at a fast
              pace, delivering high quality features to a green field user base.
              This required strong communication and prioritisation skills to
              achieve the best product within strict and short timeframes.
              Within this role, I transitioned my knowledge to work with NuxtJS
              on Front end, and MongoDB with Express on the Back end.
