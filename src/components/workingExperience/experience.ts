    role: "Frontend Software Developer",
    description: `Working as Front End Software Developer within a fast pace start up, I’m
required to wear many hats. Entering a new industry (hospitality marketing)
has allowed me to harness my skills as a product-minded developer, having
a greater reach to new customers with a unique set of problems.
My daily work focuses on surfacing key metrics that our customers use to
inform and drive their marketing strategies. By ensuring accuracy of
metrics, I am able to build trust with our customers and increase stickiness
with our product - which built in PHP and Laravel.
I also lead on a React Native app used in over 350 restaurants across the
UK.

I am currently focusing on improving our release process to shorten the
delivery loop from 3-5 days to 1hr by using OTA updates via Expo.
Through my code & custom built activations, our customers are able to
make strategic marketing decisions that has unlocked over 24%
incremental conversions, leading to increased bookings and additional
revenue for their brands.

    role: "Fullstack Software Engineer",
    description: `Following a promotion in December 2022, I took in further responsibly within the team. This included bringing forward new ideas and executing them to ensure a stable platform as the product usage continues to grow. 
    
    An example of this was ‘Storage locations’ that allows farmers to see what they have in each store, the capacity & when movements are occurring - which is normally filled out in multiple spreadsheets. I have built a strong relationship with stake holders with the company, collaborating to solve complex issues our users face on a regular basis. 
    
    This in turn has helped me build knowledge on problem solving and creating simple solutions with code (primarily Vuejs with Typescript connecting to OpenAPI backend). 
    
    In this time, I also relocated to Australia for 4 months, effectively communicating & working across timezones with my team back in the UK.`,

In this role, I learnt to work at a fast pace, delivering high quality features to a green field user base. This required strong communication and prioritisation skills to achieve the best product within strict and short timeframes. Within this role, I transitioned my knowledge to work with NuxtJS on Front end, and MongoDB with Express on the Back end. 
    
    During this role, I found I deeply enjoy a fast paced environment that allows for ambitious thinking & exploring new ideas/tools. I worked along side an incredibly talented group of engineers who encouraged my out-the-box thinking & distilled best practices that I continue to use in my career.`,
