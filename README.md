# Evie Perren

Full stack Software Engineer specialising in Front-end development currently working in a Agri-Tech SAAS start-up based in London.

With a strong passion for problem solving and over 4 years experience, I have learnt build maintainable features to complex challenges to a high quality, following best practices and delivering within the required deadline.

Since August 2018, I have dedicated by free time to strengthening my skills to be more of an asset to my team. In 2020, I passed an apprenticeship with Firebrand, receiving a Level 4 Software Developer accreditation (equivalent to first year of Bachelorâ€™s degree programme).

As a side project to strengthen my skills, I have been working on building a React Native Fitness app. This includes developing and maintaining a Postgres database and Express APIs to retrieve the data.
